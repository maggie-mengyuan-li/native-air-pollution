Code and data for upcoming paper: Air Pollution Monitoring and Exposure Levels in American Indian (AI) vs. Non-AI populated counties

1) PM25 Data Cleaning ----------> contains code used to read in and clean monitor and modeled PM2.5 estimates
2) Defining Variables ----------> contains code used to define county type (AI/non-AI), assign annual mean county level monitor PM2.5 
3) Monitor Cleaning ------------> contains code used to create descriptive stats for monitor distribution, aggregate concentrations to the county level
4) Multi-pollutant_model ----> contains the code for the health model that includes all PM2.5 components
5) Pollutant-specific_model -> contains the code for the health model that contains only one PM2.5 component but is adjusted for total PM2.5 mass
